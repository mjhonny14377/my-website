  This website is built from scratch with HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP & JAVASCRIPT.
  This website contains my achievements and certifications so that it could be easy for recruiters to know my skills.
  It also has information on how to contact me via mail(most preferrable) or post or through a call.
  Anyone can get in touch with me to know more about my project.
  I would love to take suggestions  or feedback on how to make my website even better.
  Here is a link for the git hub hosting
